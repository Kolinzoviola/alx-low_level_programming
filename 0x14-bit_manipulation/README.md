Todays task is all about Bit manipulation
this refers to the manipulation of individual bits 
within a binary number to achieve a specific task or result

There are 6 mandatory and 2 advanced task

i will try to manipulate data use bits to achieve my tasks

Task 0

function that converts binary to an unsigned int
prototype unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b) will be 
in the main.h file
i may use _putchar.c
i am to return converted number or 0
main.c file is also available 

Task 1

function printing binary rep of a number 
arrays and malloc are not allowed and % and or / not allowed
Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

Task 2

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)

fucntion that returns value of a bit at a given index
returns value of index or -1 if error

Task 3
Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)

function sets value of a bit to 1
returns  0r -1

Task 4

functions that sets value of a bit to 0
Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)

returns 1 or -1

Task 5
Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);


 function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another

Task 6
function that checks endiannes: 
this refers to the byte order in which multibyte data types, 
such as integers and floating-point numbers, are stored in 
computer memory or transmitted over networks
Prototype: int get_endianness(void)
returns 0 or 1

Task 7
find the password for the; https://github.com/alx-tools/0x13.c
ave the password in the file 101-password
Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
