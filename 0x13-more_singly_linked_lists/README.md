A Project on More singly linked lists
the project is on usefulness of singly linked lists
Task 0

writting a function that all the elements of a listint_t list
allowed to use printf and Return of nodes end the program 

Task 1

writing the function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list

Task 2

writing a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list and 
returns an address of a New element

Task 3

function adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list
and returns a new address or NULL if it fails 

Task 4

a function that frees a listint_t list

Task 5

fucntion at frees a listint_t list and sets the head to NULL

Task 6

functions deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n)
and returns 0 if empty

Task 7 
functions returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list
index is the index of the node, starting at 0
return 0 if node does not exist

Task 8
function returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list
and 0 if list is empty

Task 9

functions  inserts a new node at a given position.
where idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added. Index starts at 0
Returns: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
if it is not possible to add the new node at index idx, do not add the new node and return NULL

Task 10
functions that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
where index is the index of the node that should be deleted. Index starts at 0
Returns: 1 if it succeeded, -1 if it failed
